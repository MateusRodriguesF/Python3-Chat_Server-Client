# Python3-Chat_Server-Client
A local network python chat. 
My name Mateus Rdorigues and im a beginner in python, so i created a simple socket chat for training purposes.
Is a simple Chat designed to work in a local area network.
For more users, all you need to do is copy e paste the client.py and create a new file.
Im looking for using threads, for simultaneously receiving messages, 
please if somebody could help me with this, i would be very gratefull, thank you.

<b>How it works</b>

Fire it up a cmd in windows and go to the files location.
Simple type it python chatserver.py and hit enter, now your server should be working.
and then type it python client.py to run the client side.
thats all.
